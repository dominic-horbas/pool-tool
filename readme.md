## Draft type hockey pool tool 

Very basic week end application that I made for a hockey pool. Based on the Laravel 5.1 framework.

Set your rules in config/rules.php
Set your database settings in the .env file.
Migrate the database with "php artisan migrate"
Import the NHL data you want. In the database. If you want you can use the scrapers in my other repos or use the data in resource/assets/ and manually map them using a tool like sequel pro
